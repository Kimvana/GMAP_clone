# GMAP

This is the main version of GMAP. Both the stable release version (main branch) and developments (other branches) can be found here.

GMAP is a package of tools for use in computing spectra from molecular dynamics trajectories. Currently, the main event is GEM, which supports both vibrational and electronic spectroscopy.

## How to install 

The installation instructions mention using a venv. This virtual environment is a little like a quarantine for modules. Anything you do in the virtual environment, stays there. So if multiple programs need different versions of the same module, you don't have to keep re-installing that module when switching programs.

While the instructions work without one, it is definitely good practice to use one, so we highly recommend it!

### Installation for general users:
1. Make sure you have a valid python installation. For details, see [Version information](#version-information)
2. Clone this github repo, and navigate to the directory this file is located in.
3. Using ```python -m venv env_GMAP```, create a virtual environment.
4. Activate the environment by running
   * (Unix)  ```source env_GMAP/bin/activate```
   * (Windows) ```env_GMAP\Scripts\activate.bat``` (doesn't work in powershell)
5. (optional) Don't forget to compile the GMAP C library! There are also some maps that might need to have their C libraries installed, they will mention this in their README. Compilation instructions are system dependent, and given lower down in this file. After this installation, the program is ready for use. 

   This step is optional, because compiled versions of all files come with the program. If you'd rather compile yourself than using ours, this is the time to do so!
6. Install GMAP:
   * (general users, use wheel, windows) run ```python3 -m pip install dist\gmap-0.0.1-py3-none-any.whl```
   * (general users, use wheel, unix) run ```python3 -m pip install dist/gmap-0.0.1-py3-none-any.whl```
   * (general users, rebuild wheel) run ```python3 -m pip install .```
   * (developers) run ```python3 -m pip install -e ".[testing]"```
7. now, from anywhere, typing ```GMAP``` will start the program. If not, something has gone wrong. However, we're not done yet.
8. Once you're done using the program, you can deactivate the environment again by typing 'deactivate' (without the quotation marks in the terminal/command line).

### Installation for developers
1. Follow steps 1-6 of the non-developer guide.
2. Build your changes before opening a PR. ``pip install build`` if you don't have it yet; then ``python -m build`` (all from repo home directory)
3. only relevant for some developers: If you want to fully profile the code and have GMAP generate the flow-chart-png for you, an installation of [graphvis](https://graphviz.org/) must be present. It is responsible for executing the 'dot' command on the command line. At the moment of writing this, a single test will fail if graphvis is not installed.

### How to use (after installing)
1. Make sure you installed the program.
2. Activate the environment you created during installation. Activation instructions are in step 3 of the installation instructions.
3. Run the program; do what you want to do.
4. After you're done, you deactivate your environment, just as in step 7 of installation.

## How to generate the documentation using sphinx:
A pre-built version of the documentation [can be found here](https://lacourjansenlab.github.io/GMAP/). If you still want to generate it yourself, read on!

Assuming generating from scratch, and inside a venv (see above, always a good habit)
1. When doing this in a different repository (i.e. no automagical module installs), make sure to run ```pip install sphinx```, ```pip install numpydoc```, and (optionally) ```pip install pydata-sphinx-theme```
2. Create a directory for all sphinx output using ```mkdir sphinx```. It is preferred this directory lives in the base directory of your project (in case of GMAP, the same directory as where this document is located).
3. Navigate to the newly created directory. Inside, run ```sphinx-quickstart```. You are prompted to make some choices, but the defaults are good enough. Just keep hitting enter until done. This will create a file named ```conf.py``` and one named ```index.rst```, along with some makefiles. Remember the abovementioned two files, they're important!
4. Make the following changes to the conf.py:
  * At the very top of the file, add the line ```import sys``` and ```from pathlib import Path```
  * a bit further down, replace ```extensions = []``` with ```extensions = ['sphinx.ext.autodoc', 'numpydoc']```
  * just below this, there are definitions for templates_path and exclude_patterns. Just below there, add the following line: ```sys.path.append(str((Path(__file__).parent).resolve()))```
  * **if** you installed the pydata theme earlier, replace the line ```html_theme = 'alabaster'``` line further down in the document with ```html_theme = 'pydata_sphinx_theme'```
5. Within the sphinx output directory, create another directory for the api output using ```mkdir api_out```
6. **Without** changing directories, run ```sphinx-apidoc -efP -o api_out --templatedir=_templates ../GMAP```. When building for a different project, make sure to point to the base folder of the **code** part of your project. Meaning of flags:
  * -e means that each module will get its own page
  * -f means that files will be overwritten when/where needed
  * -P means that private methods/classes/functions will be documented, too
  * -o is the marker that the named directory is the intended output directory.
  * --templatedir points to the directory with templates. These change the output from apidoc.
7. Make the following changes to index.rst (you know, that file created in step 3):
  * replace ```:maxdepth: 2``` with ```:maxdepth: 4``` in case your project is very nested like GMAP
  * right below this line, add the line ```:glob:``` - make sure to match the indentation of the lines above!
  * right below the glob line, add an empty line, followed by the line ```api_out/**.rst```. Again, make sure to mind indentation!
8. Within the sphinx output directory, run the following commands:
  * (optional if familiar with output) ```make``` - this will show all supported document types to generate docs. We'll be using basic html here, but note the fact you can also generate a pdf, man file, and many more!
  * (developers only) don't forget to do a build with the line defining 'suppress_warnings' in conf.py disabled to check what's being suppressed!
  * Build the documentation of your choice. In case of html, the command will be ```make html```

The final step will report on how the documentation building went, and report any errors/issues. The documentation should build without errors. If not - the following issues are known and proven harmless:

- any issues about formatting specifically in docstrings in the .py files. Mostly unexpected indentations.
- html_static_path entry '_static' does not exist.

Any other issues/errors should be reported (or fixed if you introduced it). Examples include (_but are not limited to!_):

- Any warnings including the text 'unknown document' or 'nonexistent document'.
- Any warnings saying 'document isn't included in any TOCtree'.
- Any warnings reporting issues with 'target's.

The ouput files will be inside the sphinx folder, in _build/html. Open _build/html/index.html to get to the home page of your 'website'.

In case you build html documents, the interlinking is relative: you can move (and rename) the 'html' folder to your liking. It can be shared and everything, and it should even be compatible with github pages (if I understand things correctly).

When you've made some choices to the code, and would like to rebuild the docs, not all steps have to be followed again. For minor changes, it is sufficient to redo step 8 only. For major changes (those that involve the addition/removal/restructuring of (sub)modules), restart at step 6.

## how to compile C code

- compiled versions of the (VEG) c library are included in the respository. However, these are system dependent and you may need to recompile it for your own system.
- If you need to compile any files, be it for GMAP itself or for one of the maps used by it, make sure to navigate to the directory containing the .cpp file before following further compilation instructions.

### files that need compiling

* (always) GMAP/sourcefiles/VEG.cpp (see instructions below)
* (optional) GMAP/maps/Pairs/ProteinAmide_TCC/src/TCC_clib.cpp (modified command, see TCC map README). This is only needed if the map is used.
* (optional) GMAP/maps/Pairs/TrEsp/src/TrEsp_clib.cpp (modified command, see TrEsp map README). This is only needed if the map is used.

### windows

For GMAP to automatically recognize the compiled versions of scripts, the intended OS has to be added to the name. For windows (depending on your OS and python version), this means that the name should end in ```_Win32bit``` or ```_Win64bit```. If you do not do that, you can still manually supply your compiled file to GMAP, but the autodetection will not work.

- make sure to install microsoft visual studio (detailed instructions are a must - [AIM repository](github.com/kimvana/AIM) has them in the manual, page 12).
- through windows start menu, scroll trough list of programs, select visual studio folder, in there, the desired command prompt. x64 Native Tools for 64 bit windows, x86 Native Tools for 32 bit. __Make sure to open the command prompt in admin mode__.
- run one of the following commands: 
  ```cl.exe /LD /Fe: VEG_Win64bit scriptname.cpp``` (64 bit windows / python installation)
  ```cl.exe /LD /Fe: VEG_Win32bit scriptname.cpp``` (32 bit windows / python installation)
  (This step generates 4 files)
- use the .dll file for the program (ignore or delete the other 3 generated ones).


### linux

For GMAP to automatically recognize the compiled versions of scripts, the intended OS has to be added to the name. For linux, this means that the name (including the extension) should end in ```_Linux.so```. If you do not do that, you can still manually supply your compiled file to GMAP, but the autodetection will not work.

- open terminal
- To compile the c-library use ```g++ -fPIC -shared -o scriptname_Linux.so scriptname.cpp```

For example, the VEG library can be compiled with ```g++ -fPIC -shared -o VEG_Linux.so VEG.cpp``` 

(if installed, using cc instead of g++ also works)


### mac

For GMAP to automatically recognize the compiled versions of scripts, the intended OS has to be added to the name. For mac, this means that the name (including the extension) should end in ```_MacOS.dylib```. If you do not do that, you can still manually supply your compiled file to GMAP, but the autodetection will not work.

Please note that depending on your mac version, the instructions are slightly different, and that Apple occasionally changes the way that the OS works resulting in changes in how to compile c++ code. Please, consult with updates from Apple if the commands below don't work on your system.

- open terminal
- Compile the code with one of the following commands (system dependent):
  - ```cc -fPIC -dynamiclib -o scriptname_MacOS.dylib scriptname.cpp``` (works on older macs)
  - ```cc -fPIC -dynamiclib -std=c++11 -stdlib=libc++ -o scriptname_MacOS.dylib scriptname.cpp``` (needed on newer versions like Sonoma 14.6.1 to avoid alias warnings)
  
For example, the VEG library can be compiled with ```g++ -fPIC -shared -o VEG_MacOS.dylib VEG.cpp``` or ```cc -fPIC -dynamiclib -std=c++11 -stdlib=libc++ -o VEG_MacOS.dylib VEG.cpp```



## Differences between GMAP and AIM

On a glance, the GMAP package might seem similar to AIM. How does it differ, and why should one want to switch from AIM to GMAP?

### GMAP has a larger scope
This might be pedantic, but GMAP is not comparable to AIM. AIM is a program that does a single thing, while GMAP is a package with multiple functionalities. One of the tools it contains, GEM, **is** comparable to AIM. It was the first tool to be developed within the package.


### Major differences between GMAP/GEM and AIM

- **Extended to UV-vis.** GEM is designed with a broader scope in mind from the beginning. One of the big consequences of this is that GEM can deal with electronic spectra predictions (UV-vis) much more easily than AIM could.
- **Non-orthorhomic system support.** The GMAP package has functionality that allows GEM to treat MD systems that have non-90-degree angles (not orthorhombic). These systems are often preferred in MD simulations (especilly of proteins), as they require less solvent.
- **Multiple-residue-oscillators.** GEM can work with singles/oscillators/dyes that live on multiple residues much more easily than AIM could. The Amide-I vibration of proteins (backbone) is one example of such an oscillator (and had a special implementation in AIM), other examples can be found in, for example, polymers.
- **Support for much larger MD systems.** GEM can output just energies/frequencies (the diagonal of the hamiltonian), while AIM had to output the full upper-diagonal hamiltonian. This means the largest feasible system (for subsequent treating with NISE) is at least tens of thousands of singles for GEM, opposed to roughly 1.5 thousand for AIM. 


### Differences in function between GMAP/GEM and AIM

- **Soft cutoff.** GMAP supports a soft cutoff where the 'weight' with which a charge is considered decreases with distance, whereas AIM either considered an atom, or it didn't.
- **Double positions output.** GMAP has the double-positions output, which NISE requires for some calculations.
- **NSA not yet implemented.** GMAP does not yet have the NSA algorithm implemented for faster electrostatics.
- **Mandatory C code.** GEM cannot run without a compiled C library. This makes the code much easier to maintain, and NISE also requires users to know how to compile C.
- **Coupling method selection.** GEM has more freedom than AIM with choosing coupling methods. GEM allows on a per-singles-map basis to choose the method, while AIM only allows turning dipole-dipole coupling on or off between (mis)matched pairs.
- **Missing features.** The following features were present in AIM, but not yet in GMAP/GEM. They are planned, so should be coming in due time. Need them now, contact us to see if we can find a workaround!
  - The functionality of the AIM parameter Scale_LR_coupling has not yet been implemented.
- **Easier whitelisting/blacklisting of singles** By default, GMAP can work with residue numbers and residue names (number/name of the residue of the zeroeth atom of the oscillator), but maps can add their own.
- **Legend file output.** The legend file contains a short description for each row in the hamiltonian/dipoles array. No more second-guessing which frequency belongs to which site!
- **Coupling method visualization output.** The couplingvis file has a diagram showing which coupling method has been used for which coupling value in the hamiltonian. Especially useful for mixed systems (e.g. proteins) that use multiple coupling methods at the same time.
- **Automated testing suite.** While most users won't see anything directly from the tests, their existence means its much easier to confirm the code functions as expected, with no bugs or the like.



### Quality of Life differences between GMAP/GEM and AIM

- **Code-free maps.** When creating a map for GMAP, it is no longer needed to know code. AIM however requires some python for every map. Often very simple code, but code nonetheless. GMAP can support a variety of maps without any code. Where code is needed (more complex mappings do), it is easier to integrate with the main program.
- **Automatic installation.** GMAP must be automatically installed, while this was optional for AIM. The GMAP installation is up-to-date with the newer conventions (whereas that of AIM isn't). This also means GMAP will come with a wheel. No more manual installation of dependencies.
- **Begone, resnames file.** The resnames file as it existed with AIM is no longer a thing. GMAP now has an influencer file system, but it is optional. During a run, the log file / command line output will mention which residues are(n't) considered, and only if that doesn't match the users needs/desires, will the user have to touch it. 
- **More legible command line output.** GMAP has a clearer output/report on the command line. It has colors (optional!), says what it's doing, and it reports more discovered information sooner (e.g. how many molecules were found in the MD system). It also indicates when (day/date/time) it started and thinks it'll finish. It still tells (as a stopwatch, in minutes/hours) how long it's been running, and how much longer it'll need, just like AIM.
- **Command line parameter specification.** GMAP allows parameter specification on the command line. Want to do a series of calculations with the same input file, but change one parameter per calculation? Prefer seeing parameter choices in the call to GMAP? This feature is the answer. You can still use input parameter files in the same way as you could with AIM.
- **Easier troubleshooting.** Got an error from the program? It now has an error code associated with it. There is an error page in the manual, listing all possible codes. Each code has some explanation and, where relevant, links to relevant documentation pages to get more information on how to solve the error.
- **More maps.** GMAP will ship with a larger variety of maps than AIM did.
- **Incomplete maps.** GEM can deal with incomplete maps, as long as they specify their incompleteness correctly. No need to specify how to calculate the Raman tensor if you tell GEM your map cannot compute those anyways.
- **Calling GMAP from another python script.** While in theory possible, AIM never explicitly supported this. Now, GMAP contains no quit()'s, exit()'s, or sys.exit()'s. Only raise's. This makes it easier to catch a failed run when calling GMAP from another python script directly. There's also a function designed as the gateway into GMAP that your script can directly call.
- **Units are dead, long live the units.** GMAP is more flexible using different units than AIM was. The user can specify in which units the output files should be given, and custom-made maps can mention what units their contents assume.
- **Variable parameters.** This is highly-map specific, but the AmideBB and AmideSC maps are shipped with variable parameters. The angles/magnitudes used by various models can now be changed using those parameters.
- **Better file management.** A small change can make a huge difference. When GMAP creates new files, it makes sure to not overwrite any old ones of the same name if they already exist. Unless you tell it it should, of course!
- **Web-based manual.** The GMAP manual is [website-based](https://lacourjansenlab.github.io/GMAP/), instead of AIM's pdf documentation. Pages are linked together, and even the full documentation of the codebase can be found (helpful for developers).
- **Silencing warnings.** Ever screamed at your PC "I know, stupid thing! But it doesn't matter!"? We have. Now, you can tell the program to not complain/quit at any warning of your choice. However, use it at your own risk, the warnings are there for a reason!


## Version information

In order to use GMAP, you need to have a valid python installation. In this context, valid means that the correct version of python (and modules) is used, and that the python environment contains only modules whose versions work together.

Here follows an overview of versions that have been tested to work, but keep in mind that not every combination of every version and every module has been tested. The version printed in bold is the version used for development - this is considered the most stable. Versions between brackets have not all been tested, but are considered safe.

When you need to replicate a 'proven' environment - the `requirements_py3_10.txt` file is a mirror of the most used development environment in python 3.10.11. The `requirements_py3.13.txt` file is a mirror for a tested environment in python 3.13.1.
