class System:
    """Stores all information on the MD system and objects therein

    Parameters
    ----------
    run_pars : :class:`~GMAP.src.tools.parameter_parser.RunPars`
        The 'main' RunPars instance containing all the basic
        run-defining parameters.

    Attributes
    ----------
    universe : `MDAnalysis.Universe`
        The universe that is analyzed this run.
    atnums : `np.ndarray`
        A 1D array of length self.natoms storing the atom indices.
        First atom is numbered 0, every next index is 1 larger than the
        previous one. Counting never resets.
    atnames : `np.ndarray`
        A 1D array of length self.natoms storing the name of each atom.
    resnums : `np.ndarray`
        A 1D array of length self.natoms storing the number of the
        residue each atom belongs to. First residue is numbered 0, each
        subsequent residue gets an index 1 larger than the previous one.
        Counting never resets.
    resnames : `np.ndarray`
        A 1D array of length self.natoms storing the name of the residue
        each atom belongs to.
    positions : `np.ndarray`
        A 2D array of shape [self.natoms, 3] storing the position of
        each atom in the MD system.
    masses : `np.ndarray`
        A 1D array of length self.natoms storing the mass of each atom.
    charges : `np.ndarray`
        A 1D array of length self.natoms storing the charge of each
        atom. This is the charge as used by the MD system, not as a
        certain map might need it.
    types : `np.ndarray`
        A 1D array of length self.natoms storing the type of each atom.
        A type is often dependent on the forcefield used - each element
        can have multiple types associated with it. In the MD
        calculation, each type has certain force field parameters
        associated with it.
    segids : `np.ndarray`
        A 1D array of length self.natoms storing the name of the segment
        each atom belongs to.
    natoms : `np.int32`
        The amount of atoms found in the MD trajectory.
    nres : `np.int32`
        The amount of residues found in the MD trajectory.
    boxdims : `np.ndarray`
        The length of the 3 vectors defining the MD simulation box
        (its PBC). These are the first 3 entries returned by
        MDA.Universe.dimensions.
    halfbox : `np.ndarray`
        Same as boxdims, but each value is divided by 2.
    angles : `np.ndarray`
        The angles between the three vectors defining the MD simulation
        box (its PBC). These are the last 3 entries returned by
        MDA.Universe.dimensions.
    boxvects : `np.ndarray`
        The vectors defining the MD box. boxvects.shape == (3, 3).
        boxvects[i] returns one of the three vectors.
        The result of MDA.lib.mdamath.triclinic_vectors(
        self.universe.dimensions)
    boxvects_inv : `np.ndarray`
        The inverse of the rotation matrix self.boxvects.
    safesphere : float
        The radius of the sphere in which distances can be calculated
        accurately. If the length of any vector exceeds this size, there
        is a chance that vector is not actually the shortest available.
    residues : :class:`~GMAP.src.tools.system_reader.Residues`
        This class contains information on a per-residue basis instead
        of a per-atom basis like this class does.
    rightangled : bool
        Whether self.angles only contains 90 degree angles.
    neutral : bool
        Whether the total charge of the MD system (the sum of
        self.charges) equals 0. The precision used can be changed using
        the parameter
        :ref:`neutral_charge_threshold<UserGuide_page_parameter_overview>`.
    oscillators : list of :class:`~GMAP.src.tools.system_reader.Oscillator`
        All oscillators that were found in the MD system. These are the
        ones calculations will be performed on.
    influencers_atix : list of int
        The indices of all atoms that should be considered influencers.
    nosc : int
        The amount of oscillators present in the system.
    oscillators_ordered : dict of str: list of \
        :class:`~GMAP.src.tools.system_reader.Oscillator` pairs
        All oscillators, but grouped by the map they belong to.
    oscillators_ordered_ix : dict of str: list of int pairs
        Same as oscillators_ordered, but only listing oscillator indices
        instead of oscillator objects.
    oscillators_ordered_coup : dict of str: list of \
        :class:`~GMAP.src.tools.system_reader.Oscillator` pairs
        All oscillators, but grouped by the coupling map they belong to.
        This structure is intended for use by prep-methods of coupling
        maps, as it is a simple overview of all oscillators that the
        coupling map will treat
    oscillators_ordered_coup_ix : dict of str: list of int pairs
        Same as oscillators_ordered_coup, but only listing oscillator indices
        instead of oscillator objects.
