    keyword is its own dictionary key. Most keywords can only occur once

    The program finds all oscillators mathing the instructions from
    core.txt. However, there is no way for the program to avoid double
    counting symmetrical groups (like the cystbridge mockup example).
    If a map knows its group is symmetrical, this function can be
    designed to only return half of the inputs.

    Another possible use is for the code of the map to get to know its
    oscillators. When all oscillators are passed through this function,
    the (global) atom number of the first atom of this group (for
    example) can be linked to a specific property the group might need
    to know. This might be useful if a map needs to cover two very
    similar oscillators.

    .. note::
        This function is called separately for each struct that the map

    Reason for this is the nearest-neighbour correction to the

    of the neighbouring oscillator, which are not updated/generated

def GM_report_references(map_, system):
    """Returns all references that should be reported for this map.

    This function does not have to account for which outputs are
    actually requested from the program - the text in the reporttext
    field in the references.bib file already does that. It indicates
    for which methods it should be reported, and with which text.

    If this function is absent from a main.py, map_.references will be
    returned in it's entirety. The purpose of this function is to
    return a selection/subset of that dictionary, instead.

    In the case of this mapping, there are different methods for
    computing the different properties of the system, so we only want
    to send those of the selected mapping through, and leave the rest.

    Parameters
    ----------
    map_ : :class:`~GMAP.src.tools.map_reader.Map`
        The object that stores everything the program currently knows
        about this map.
    system : :class:`~GMAP.src.tools.system_reader.System`
        The object that stores everything the program currently knows
        about the system being treated (names, numbers, types, masses,
        charges of all atoms, for example)

    Returns
    -------
    references_dict : dict
        This dict should be a slice/part of the full map_.references
        dict. Therefore, an explanation of the map_.references dict:

        The keys in this dictionary are the separate keys listed in the
        reference.bib file's 'mapkey' field. If the reference has
        multiple keys in that field, it will occur multiple times in the
        dictionary, once for each key.

        Associated with each key is a list of
        :class:`~GMAP.src.tools.reference_handler.Reference` objects,
        each of which corresponds to a single entry in the .bib file.
